            It was the first day of Physics practical and I was already fifteen minutes late, practically running with a heavy bag full of books. I rushed to Block 2 of my college building and then ran up the stairs to the third floor which was apparently very quiet. The only thing I saw at the end of the hall was a shadow of a girl standing outside the lab with a bag on her arms. I probably didn't recognise her at that very moment. In my mind I had already assumed that she was told to stand outside for being late and that the very same thing is going to happen to me. I literally just stoop straight up right there thinking of all the possibilites of what could happen now. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I walked up to her. She was my classmate, although at that time, I didn't really knew her name. To be honest, for a moment I forgot how pretty she was. *ahem, ahem*
            <br>
            "Hey", I said while heavily breathing in and out. <br>
            "Hi", she replied.<br>
            "Is Mrs. Sen in already?", I asked.<br>
            "Yeah."<br>
            "Oh shit! She's gonna kill me for being this late. What did she say to you?"<br>
            "Nothing! I didn't even go in."<br>
            "Wait... What?"<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay. Now was probably a good time to maybe just go inside, give this a try, talk to the teacher, but no.
