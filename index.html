    <p>Hi. My name is <span class="bold">Shubhkirti Sharma</span> and I am a <span class="green">full stack developer</span> with expertise in <span class="blue">frontend design and development.</span></p>
    <p>Though I was born in the state of Bihar, I was bred in Delhi in India and later moved to Chandigarh to pursue my Bachelor's in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I have a knack for visually appealing websites and typography and thus I love exploring web spaces and <a href="#">AWWWARDS.</a></p>.
    <p>I have worked on several personal projects such as <a href="#">nucleon.css</a>, which is a personal, light weight skeleton CSS framework I use to initilize any project.</p>
