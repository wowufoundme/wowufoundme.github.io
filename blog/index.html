                Chapter 1 – The Final Practical
            </div>
            <div class="ch-content">
                <p>
                    He was running, as fast as he could. Well, why wouldn’t he? It was his final practical of Physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He reached his block. It was quiet, as expected on a Saturday. 
                    As he entered the building, he rushed towards the staircase and reached the first floor.
                    He was anxious, nervous and of course worried that he won't be allowed to give his practical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The complete floor was empty. Only a girl standing outside the practical lab,
                    with her bag and a practical file in her right hand. Inside he knew he was doomed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was there standing at the lab's door. The girl standing right next
                    him took a small peek at him, as he was sweating. With all his courage he entered the lab.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It had only been a moment or two before he stepped out and stood still right next to the door,
                    opposite to her.
                    He seemed lost. Whispering in a nervous tone he asked her "Were you late too?".
                    "Yeah.", she replied. About five minutes passed in silence, when one of his friend came outside 
                    and said "Ma'am is calling you both inside!". They walked in as he followed her. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This is your final practical and you are late. How can someone be so irresponsible?" Mrs. Dhingra shouted. 
                    She was the head of Physics department. She was an ok kind-of teacher, with a fair complexion and                    
                    perfect height. She was sitting right next to the lab in-charge Mr. Rao, a very polite person who would help anyone when they get stuck
                    with any practical. "What practical has not been assigned to any group?" she asked Mr. Rao. Now in our college practicals
                    were to be performed in groups of two and we had two sections. During the final practical, she decided to take the practical 
                    of both the computer science sections together. He was in first and she in second.
                    After thinking and looking around for a minute, Mr. Rao replied, "I think we have one Rutherford's experiment setup left.".
